Node pointers are stored in open and closed lists instead of Node objects for several reasons:
1. Iterator can use nullptr to determine the Node before the start Node, which can't be done using TileIndex since all values of TileIndex are valid.
2. Node member variables can be marked as const, which can't be done if they are stored directly in the containers.
3. cheapest_open_node can return nullptr instead of having to take in and modify a status variable.

Notes on smart pointers.
1. std::shared_ptr more than doubles computation time compared to raw pointers:
	shared_ptr average time while finding: start at 0.85, slowly lowers to .84, .83
	shared_ptr ~Path() time: 0.0197494 seconds
	raw average time while finding: start at 0.36
	raw ~Path() time: 0.0108117 seconds
